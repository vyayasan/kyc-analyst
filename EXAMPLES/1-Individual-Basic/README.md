## Scenario Summary

**Customer Profile:**
- John Smith, 40-year-old British software engineer
- 5 years tenure at TechCorp Solutions Ltd
- £85,000 annual salary
- UK resident
- Married (spouse not on account)
- Opening personal current & savings account

**Application Status:**
- Complete documentation
- All required identity, address, and employment documents provided
- No red flags in initial assessment

**Expected Outcome:**
- All Step 0 searches return CLEAR results
- Risk assessment = LOW (13/100)
- Decision = PROCEED
- No escalation required
- Analyst approval sufficient

---

## Step 0 Verification Workflow

### Search 1: Adverse Media
**Expected Result:** CLEAR
- 72+ sources searched (Google News, BBC, Reuters, FT, legal databases)
- No negative findings
- No regulatory actions
- No litigation or financial enforcement

**Why This Matters:** Establishes clean background, no public controversies or regulatory issues

### Search 2: Directorships
**Expected Result:** CLEAR
- Companies House search completed
- No active directorships
- No historical directorships
- No hidden business interests

**Critical Point:** This search catches customers who fail to disclose business directorships - a common source of material misrepresentation

### Search 3: PEP Status
**Expected Result:** NOT PEP
- Screened against 5 PEP databases
- No political positions identified
- Spouse Emma Smith also checked: NOT PEP
- No family connections to political figures

**Why This Matters:** PEP status indicates higher risk requiring enhanced due diligence; this clear result enables standard onboarding

### Search 4: Professional Background
**Expected Result:** VERIFIED
- LinkedIn profile matches all claims
- Employment verified with payslips
- Employment contract dated 01/03/2021
- Education credentials confirmed
- No discrepancies between claims and verified evidence

**Key Learning:** Multi-source verification creates evidence trail; this prevents onboarding based on false claims

### Search 5: Sanctions & Crime
**Expected Result:** CLEAR
- Screened against 12 sanctions/legal sources
- No OFAC, EU, or UK sanctions matches
- No criminal records
- No insolvencies
- No County Court Judgments

**Regulatory Requirement:** Mandatory screening per UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017

## Risk Assessment Breakdown

**Total Risk Score: 13/100** (LOW Risk Band: 0-20)

| Factor | Weight | Score | Analysis |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| Geographic Risk | 30% | 10/100 | UK resident, low-risk jurisdiction |
| Customer Risk | 35% | 15/100 | Verified employment, stable, no PEP |
| Product Risk | 25% | 15/100 | Simple personal account, standard activity |
| Channel Risk | 10% | 10/100 | Standard onboarding process |

### Why This Score is LOW
- Salaried employment = stable, verifiable income
- Clear employment history = no gaps or red flags
- Professional credentials verified = credibility established
- Zero PEP/sanctions issues = no compliance concerns
- UK jurisdiction = developed AML/CFT framework
- Simple personal account = low product risk
- All documentation complete = no information gaps

### Escalation Triggers NOT Present
- No PEP status = no need for senior review
- No complex wealth structure = no need to verify source of wealth
- No unexplained income = no need for enhanced scrutiny
- No material discrepancies = no integrity concerns
- Clean backgrounds searches = no compliance red flags

---

## Decision Point: Why PROCEED?

### Decision Gate Criteria: ALL PASSED
✓ All 5 Step 0 searches completed
✓ All searches returned CLEAR/VERIFIED results
✓ No material discrepancies between claims and evidence
✓ No escalation triggers identified
✓ Risk assessment below escalation threshold (13/100 < 20/100)
✓ Customer profile aligns with stated information

### Regulatory Basis
**UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017 Requirement:**
- Customer Due Diligence (CDD) must be completed before onboarding
- Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) required for high-risk customers
- This customer = standard risk = CDD sufficient

**FCA HANDBOOK - COND 2.3R:**
- Firms must establish the identity and verify information of customers
- Firms must verify the customer's source of funds
- This verification must be completed before establishing relationship

**This case meets all regulatory requirements.**

### Approval Authority
**Approval Level:** Analyst (Level 1)
- LOW risk profiles can be approved by analyst without senior review
- No MLRO sign-off required
- No Senior Management approval required
- Decision time: ~15 minutes (minimal overhead)

## Key Learning Points

### 1. What Makes a Case LOW-RISK?
- **Employment:** Verifiable, stable, documented salary
- **Background:** No adverse findings across all searches
- **Complexity:** Simple, straightforward profile
- **Geography:** Developed country residence and nationality
- **Transparency:** Candidate makes claims that match verified evidence

### 2. The Critical Role of Step 0 Searches
Step 0 verification is the foundation of all onboarding:
- **Search 1 (Adverse Media):** Establishes no public controversies or regulatory issues
- **Search 2 (Directorships):** Catches hidden business interests (material misrepresentation detector)
- **Search 3 (PEP):** Identifies political exposure triggering EDD requirements
- **Search 4 (Professional Background):** Verifies claims are factually true
- **Search 5 (Sanctions/Crime):** Regulatory requirement for financial crime screening

If ANY search returns concerning findings, the case escalates for enhanced review.

### 3. Risk Assessment is Deterministic
The risk score (13/100) is calculated by the system based on:
- Fixed weights for each factor (Geographic 30%, Customer 35%, Product 25%, Channel 10%)
- Objective scoring of each factor based on findings
- Mathematical calculation: no subjective judgment
- Same inputs = same score = same decision every time

### 4. Decision Gates are Clear and Objective
The decision to PROCEED is based on:
- All Step 0 searches complete? YES
- All searches returned CLEAR/VERIFIED? YES
- Material discrepancies found? NO
- Escalation triggers present? NO
- Regulatory requirements met? YES

→ PROCEED

If ANY of these was NO, the case would escalate.

### 5. Audit Trail Proves Compliance
The audit trail demonstrates:
- Every action taken and documented
- Each decision explained and timestamped
- Complete evidence trail from application to approval
- Regulatory requirements explicitly addressed
- No modification or deletion possible (locked)

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is this case LOW risk and not MEDIUM?**
A: The risk score is 13/100. The bands are: LOW (0-20), MEDIUM (21-60), HIGH (61-100). At 13, the case falls squarely in LOW. Even conservative analysts would rate this as LOW - the customer has verified employment, no PEP status, no adverse findings, and operates in a low-risk jurisdiction.

**Q: Could this case escalate?**
A: Only if the facts changed. If Step 0 searches had found:
- PEP status → Escalate
- Hidden directorships → Escalate
- Adverse media findings → Escalate
- Sanctions match → Escalate
- Unexplained wealth → Escalate
Then the case would escalate for enhanced review. But with CLEAR results, escalation is not triggered.

**Q: What if the analyst disagrees with the PROCEED decision?**
A: The decision is based on objective criteria. If an analyst believes escalation is warranted despite clear searches, they should document their reasoning. However, regulatory framework allows analyst approval for LOW risk; escalation without cause would create unnecessary delay and cost.

**Q: How often should this customer be reviewed?**
A: Annual review for LOW-risk customers. The next review date is 11 February 2027. At that point:
- Re-screen for adverse media
- Re-screen for PEP/sanctions
- Verify employment still current
- Check for new directorships
- Confirm no material changes in circumstances

## Determinism Requirement

**Critical Point:** Running the same INPUT through the system should produce outputs matching these EXPECTED files EXACTLY.

### Why Determinism Matters
- **Reproducibility:** Same facts = same decision every time
- **Fairness:** Two customers with identical profiles get identical treatment
- **Auditability:** Regulators can verify decision consistency
- **Litigation Protection:** Decisions can be objectively justified

### How Determinism is Achieved
1. **Objective Risk Scoring:** Fixed weights, mathematical calculation
2. **Locked Decision Gates:** Specific criteria that must be met
3. **Complete Documentation:** Every step recorded and timestamped
4. **Audit Trail:** Immutable proof of decision process
5. **Version Control:** All system rules versioned for consistency

### Testing Determinism
To verify the system is deterministic:
1. Onboard the same customer twice
2. Compare outputs
3. Every element should be identical (except timestamps)
4. Any variance indicates system error

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates a straightforward, compliant onboarding of a low-risk individual customer. The process is:
- **Fast:** Decision made in 15 minutes
- **Thorough:** All regulatory requirements met
- **Documented:** Complete audit trail and evidence
- **Objective:** Decision based on clear criteria
- **Reproducible:** Same inputs = same outputs every time

Use this example as the baseline for understanding KYC workflows. Most individual employees will follow this pattern. More complex cases (HNWI, corporate, escalations) will add layers of additional scrutiny, but the core Step 0 verification remains the same.
