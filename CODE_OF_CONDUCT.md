# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviour includes:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for compliance practitioners
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Unacceptable behaviour includes:**
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Sharing actual customer PII, even in "test" contexts
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Compliance-Specific Standards

Given the nature of this project (financial compliance tooling):

- **Never share real customer data** in issues, PRs, discussions, or examples
- **Never share actual SAR/STR content** — use only redacted or synthetic examples
- **Never share sanctions screening results** for real individuals
- **Always use synthetic test data** when demonstrating workflows

Violations of these compliance-specific standards will result in immediate removal.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at sandi@vyayasan.com or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sandipanee).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
