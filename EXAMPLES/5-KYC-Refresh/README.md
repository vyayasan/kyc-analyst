# Case 5: KYC-Refresh
## Annual Refresh for Existing Customer

**Case ID:** KYC-20260211-REF-JOHNSON-001
**Original Case:** KYC-20250211-ONB-JOHNSON-001 (Onboarded 11/02/2025)
**Customer:** Sarah Johnson (Anonymized)
**Scenario:** Annual KYC refresh - no material changes found
**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM (unchanged from original)
**Decision:** APPROVED - CONTINUE ACCOUNT

---

## What This Example Demonstrates

This example shows **periodic KYC refresh** for an existing customer where no material changes have occurred. Unlike onboarding cases (Cases 1-4), KYC Refresh demonstrates the ongoing compliance obligation to maintain current customer information.

### Key Characteristics
- Existing customer (onboarded 12 months ago)
- Annual refresh triggered (required at 12-month mark)
- All 5 searches re-run on updated information
- Focus on detecting material changes
- Quick approval if nothing changed
- Limited escalation risk (already vetted customer)

### Learning Objectives
Students should understand:
1. Why periodic KYC refresh is required (regulatory obligation)
2. How refresh verification differs from onboarding
3. What constitutes "material change" in refresh context
4. How to assess whether customer still matches profile
5. When to approve refresh vs escalate for further review
6. Documentation of ongoing due diligence

## Regulatory Requirement: Ongoing Due Diligence

### The Requirement

**UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017 - Regulation 10(1)(d):**
> "A firm must conduct ongoing customer due diligence on the basis of materials held by it so as to enable it to determine whether the information concerning the customer is up-to-date."

### What This Means

After onboarding, firms must:
1. **Monitor** customer activity on ongoing basis
2. **Review** customer information periodically
3. **Update** information that becomes outdated
4. **Detect** material changes in circumstances
5. **Re-assess** risk profile if changes occur

### Refresh Frequency by Risk Level

| Risk Level | Refresh Frequency | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| LOW | Every 3-5 years | Minimal risk, less frequent check |
| LOW-MEDIUM | Annual (12 months) | Standard business customers |
| MEDIUM | Every 6-12 months | Moderate complexity |
| HIGH | Every 3-6 months | HNWI, complex structures |
| CRITICAL | Quarterly or event-driven | Active monitoring required |

Sarah Johnson: LOW-MEDIUM risk = Annual refresh (every 12 months)

## Refresh vs Onboarding: Key Differences

### Onboarding (Case 1: John Smith)
- **Objective:** Initial verification, establish baseline
- **Scope:** Comprehensive assessment of new customer
- **Searches:** All 5 searches required, full depth
- **Documentation:** Complete case file created
- **Decision:** PROCEED or ESCALATE
- **Timeline:** 15-20 minutes
- **Risk:** Unknown (first time)

### Refresh (Case 5: Sarah Johnson)
- **Objective:** Confirm no material changes since last review
- **Scope:** Focus on what changed (not comprehensive re-verification)
- **Searches:** All 5 searches re-run, but with focus on changes since last review
- **Documentation:** Refresh summary added to existing case file
- **Decision:** CONTINUE or ESCALATE
- **Timeline:** 10-15 minutes (typically faster)
- **Risk:** Known (already vetted, focus on changes)

### Key Insight
Refresh is asking: "Has anything material changed?" rather than "Is this customer acceptable?"

Since customer was already approved, the bar for continuing is lower unless something changed.

## The Five-Point Refresh Check

All refreshes check five key areas:

### 1. Address Verification
**Question:** Has customer moved to different jurisdiction or address?
**Why It Matters:** Geographic risk changes (UK to UAE = higher risk)

**In This Case:**
- Previous: 22 Whitehouse Terrace, Edinburgh
- Current: Same address
- Result: NO CHANGE

### 2. Employment/Business Status
**Question:** Has customer changed employment or business?
**Why It Matters:** Employment changes can indicate income source change or higher-risk industry

**In This Case:**
- Previous: Grant Thornton, Senior Accountant
- Current: Same employer, same position
- Result: NO CHANGE (improved tenure: 8 → 9 years)

### 3. Income Level
**Question:** Has income changed significantly?
**Why It Matters:** Unexplained income changes can be red flag

**In This Case:**
- Previous: £65,000
- Current: £66,500 (+2.3%, normal annual raise)
- Result: MINOR CHANGE (expected and explained)

### 4. Adverse Activity Detection
**Question:** Any new adverse media, PEP status, sanctions, or criminal record?
**Why It Matters:** Customer circumstances can change (enter politics, face legal issues, etc.)

**In This Case:**
- Adverse media: CLEAR (no new findings)
- PEP status: NOT PEP (unchanged)
- Sanctions: CLEAR (unchanged)
- Criminal record: CLEAR (unchanged)
- Result: NO CHANGE

### 5. Transaction Pattern Consistency
**Question:** Account activity consistent with profile?
**Why It Matters:** Unusual patterns can indicate money laundering or account misuse

**In This Case:**
- Monthly deposits: £5,541 (matches salary)
- Outgoings: Utilities, groceries, entertainment (personal)
- Pattern: Consistent with personal account, no anomalies
- Result: CONSISTENT (normal account usage)

## Material vs Minor Changes

### Material Changes (Would Trigger Escalation)

Examples that would require investigation:
1. **Address:** Moved to high-risk jurisdiction (UAE, offshore)
2. **Employment:** Changed to high-risk industry (MSB, gambling, crypto)
3. **Income:** Unexplained increase (e.g., £65k → £200k with no explanation)
4. **Adverse Media:** New regulatory violation, fraud allegation, etc.
5. **PEP Status:** Entered political position (major change)
6. **Sanctions:** New match on sanctions list
7. **Criminal Record:** New conviction or criminal charge
8. **Transaction Pattern:** Major change inconsistent with profile (e.g., suddenly sending £500k internationally)

### Minor Changes (Would Not Trigger Escalation)

Examples of normal, acceptable changes:
1. **Address:** Moved within same jurisdiction (same city/country)
2. **Employment:** Promotion at same company or change within low-risk sector
3. **Income:** Normal annual raise (2-3% typical)
4. **PEP Status:** No change or former PEP becoming non-PEP (risk decreasing)
5. **Transaction Pattern:** Gradual normal increase in transaction volume with salary increase

### In This Case: ALL MINOR/NO CHANGE

- Address: Unchanged
- Employment: Unchanged (progression, not change)
- Income: Minor annual raise (normal)
- Adverse findings: No new findings
- Transaction pattern: Consistent

**Result:** NO MATERIAL CHANGES - Simple approval

## Refresh Approval Decision

### When Analyst Can Approve Refresh

Analyst can approve refresh if:
- [✓] All verification searches returned clear results
- [✓] No material changes detected
- [✓] Transaction pattern consistent with profile
- [✓] Risk profile unchanged or improved
- [✓] No new adverse findings

### When Escalation Required

Escalate refresh if:
- Material change detected (address, employment, income)
- New adverse media findings
- New PEP/sanctions match
- Transaction pattern suddenly changed
- Customer contact information outdated
- Any customer-provided information contradicts verified information

### In This Case

**All Conditions Met:** ✓ Approve refresh (no escalation needed)

---

## What Happens Next

### Immediate
1. Refresh approved
2. Update customer record: "Refresh completed 11/02/2026, no changes"
3. Set next review date: 11 February 2027

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Continue quarterly transaction pattern review
- Continue annual refresh schedule
- Watch for any changes during year
- If material change detected, escalate immediately (don't wait for scheduled refresh)

### Next Annual Refresh (11/02/2027)
Repeat the same five-point check:
1. Address verification
2. Employment status
3. Income level
4. Adverse activity screening
5. Transaction pattern consistency

## Key Learning Points

### 1. Refresh is Part of Ongoing Compliance
KYC onboarding is just the beginning. Firms must continuously update information to maintain compliance. Refresh demonstrates this ongoing obligation.

### 2. Focus on Changes, Not Re-verification
Refresh doesn't re-verify everything from scratch. It's a targeted check: "What's changed? Does that change our risk assessment?"

### 3. No News is Good News
In refresh cases, lack of changes is a good outcome. Customer continues as low-risk, no action needed beyond standard monitoring.

### 4. Material Change Detection is Key
The value of refresh is detecting when a previously clean customer develops risk factors (moves to risky country, new PEP status, unexplained wealth increase, etc.).

### 5. Timing Matters
Refreshes must be done on schedule (annually for this customer). Missing scheduled refreshes violates regulatory requirement.

## Regulatory Precedent

Regulators (FCA, NCA) audit firms' KYC programs to verify:
1. **Initial KYC:** Done properly at onboarding ✓
2. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Transaction patterns reviewed regularly ✓
3. **Periodic Review:** Information updated according to risk schedule ✓
4. **Material Change Detection:** Risks re-assessed if customer changes ✓

This refresh case demonstrates all four elements of a compliant ongoing CDD program.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do we refresh customers we've already vetted?**
A: Customer circumstances can change. Person approved as LOW-RISK in 2025 could be HIGH-RISK in 2026 (enters politics, gets sanctioned, income source changes). Refresh detects these changes.

**Q: How quick should refresh approval be?**
A: Much faster than onboarding. If no changes detected, can be 10-15 minutes. Only escalate if changes trigger investigation.

**Q: What if customer doesn't respond to refresh requests?**
A: Inability to update customer information is itself a red flag. Would trigger investigation or potential account closure if customer uncooperative.

**Q: Can refresh be done more frequently?**
A: Yes. Standard frequency is annual for LOW-MEDIUM, but higher-risk customers get quarterly checks. Event-driven reviews (material change detected) can happen anytime.

**Q: What if refresh reveals something concerning?**
A: Escalate immediately. Don't wait for scheduled manager meeting. Material change = immediate escalation.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates a straightforward annual KYC refresh where no material changes were detected. The process is faster and simpler than onboarding because the customer is already vetted. The focus shifts from "Is this customer acceptable?" (onboarding) to "Has anything changed about this customer?" (refresh).

The example shows that most refreshes will approve without escalation—most customers don't have material changes year-to-year. But refreshes serve the critical compliance function of detecting when they DO change.
