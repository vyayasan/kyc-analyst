# US Refresh Requirements

## FinCEN & OCC Framework

**Why refresh matters:** Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance on Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) requires ongoing review to maintain accurate records and detect material changes affecting risk profile.

## Refresh Intervals by Risk Category

### HIGH RISK Customers
- **Frequency:** Annual review (minimum)
- **Basis:** FinCEN guidance on Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and due diligence expectations
- **Rationale:**
  - Higher likelihood of material changes requiring detection
  - Potential for emergence of beneficial ownership concerns
  - Risk of involvement in financial crime schemes requires continuous vigilance
  - Legal obligations under Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
- **Enhanced:** More frequent review for customers with international operations, frequent jurisdictional changes, or involvement in high-risk sectors
- **Documentation:** Annual refresh report with SAR-related findings

### MEDIUM RISK Customers
- **Frequency:** Every 3 years (36-month intervals)
- **Basis:** FinCEN CDD Rule expectations
- **Rationale:** Balanced approach reflecting moderate compliance burden while maintaining reasonable assurance
- **Documentation:** Update customer profile, note any material business changes

### LOW RISK Customers
- **Frequency:** Every 3-5 years (depending on customer type)
- **Basis:** OCC and Federal Reserve guidance for lower-risk customer segments
- **Documentation:** Confirm stability, schedule next review

## Material Change Indicators (FinCEN/BSA)

**Beneficial Ownership Red Flags:**
- Beneficial owner list changes (especially 25%+ stakeholders)
- Introduction of new entities in ownership structure
- Replacement of previously identified beneficial owners
- Obscured beneficial ownership patterns

**Business Activity Changes:**
- New products or services outside original due diligence scope
- Significant increase in transaction volumes or complexity
- Geographic expansion to OFAC-sanctioned jurisdictions
- Business pivot to sectors subject to enhanced scrutiny

**Regulatory Status Changes:**
- Customer loses required licenses or regulatory authorization
- Receipt of regulatory enforcement action
- Public enforcement actions against company or principals

**Sanctions & Compliance Concerns:**
- OFAC match (requires immediate transaction blocking and SAR evaluation)
- Terrorist Financing Tracking Program (TFTP) match
- Adverse media indicating potential financial crime involvement
- Customer appears on Congressional or investigative lists

## Documentation Requirements

**Annual Refresh Report:**
- Review date and rationale
- All 5 independent searches completed
- OFAC/SDN List screening results
- New findings documented with source verification
- Comparison to prior refresh findings
- Risk category re-confirmation with explanation
- Beneficial ownership information updated (per BOI Rule compliance)
- Escalation determination and manager approval
- Next review date scheduled

**SAR Considerations:**
- If refresh reveals activity pattern consistent with potential money laundering or fraud
- Document potential indicators in refresh report
- Route to AML Compliance Officer for SAR evaluation (separate from refresh process)

**Retention:** Minimum 5 years post-account closure
