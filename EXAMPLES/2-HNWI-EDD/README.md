# Case 2: HNWI-EDD
## High-Risk HNWI with Enhanced Due Diligence

**Case ID:** KYC-20260211-ONB-THOMPSON-001
**Customer:** Alexander Thompson (Anonymized)
**Scenario:** HNWI entrepreneur with complex multi-jurisdictional business structure
**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Decision:** ESCALATED FOR MANAGER/MLRO APPROVAL (EDD Required)

---

## What This Example Demonstrates

This example shows **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) workflow** for a High Net Worth Individual (HNWI) with complex international business operations. Unlike Case 1 (straightforward LOW-risk approval), this case demonstrates when and why escalation occurs.

### Key Characteristics
- HNWI classification (£18-22m estimated net worth)
- Multiple company directorships (3 active companies)
- Multi-jurisdictional operations (UK, UAE, Free Zone)
- Complex wealth structure (business ownership, investments, real estate)
- Large expected transaction volumes (£2m+ annually)
- International business partnerships

### Learning Objectives
Students should use this example to understand:
1. What triggers EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence)
2. How HNWI cases differ from standard onboarding
3. When analyst self-approval is insufficient
4. How to escalate cases to senior management
5. What enhanced conditions look like
6. How complexity is documented without being cause for rejection
7. The distinction between "complex = escalate for review" vs "complex = reject"

**Customer Profile:**
- Alexander Thompson, 60-year-old British entrepreneur
- Resident in UAE (Dubai) for business operations
- Estimated net worth £18-22 million
- Owns/operates 3 companies across UK, UAE, Dubai free zone

- Decision = ESCALATE FOR EDD APPROVAL (not analyst self-approval)
- Pending: Manager/MLRO decision
- Likely: APPROVE WITH ENHANCED MONITORING CONDITIONS

---

## EDD Triggers & Escalation Criteria

### What is EDD?

Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is mandatory review for high-risk customers under:
- **UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017** - CDD & EDD requirements
- **EU AMLD5** - Enhanced due diligence requirements
- **FCA Handbook** - Customer due diligence standards

EDD customers require:
- Senior management approval (not analyst self-approval)
- Additional documentation and verification
- Enhanced ongoing monitoring
- More frequent reviews
- Formal approval decision documentation

### EDD Triggers (This Case)

This case triggers EDD for multiple reasons:

**1. HNWI Classification (Primary Trigger)**
- Estimated net worth: £18-22 million
- Clients with >£2-3m typically trigger enhanced scrutiny
- HNWI = Higher risk profile by regulatory definition

**2. Complex Business Structure**
- 3 active directorships across different jurisdictions
- Multiple company types (investment, trading, real estate)
- Mixed ownership structures (sole shareholder, co-ownership, trust arrangements)
- Complexity = Need for enhanced understanding

**3. International Multi-Jurisdictional Operations**
- UK operations (Thompson Capital)
- UAE operations (Gulf Trading)
- Free zone operations (Jebel Ali)
- Offshore entity involvement
- Cross-border transactions expected
- Multi-jurisdictional = Multiple regulatory regimes = Higher compliance burden

**4. Large Expected Transaction Volumes**
- Estimated £2m+ annually in transfers
- Multiple currencies expected
- International wire transfers expected
- Large volumes = Proportionally larger financial crime risk

**5. Beneficial Ownership Complexity**
- Co-shareholder arrangements (Fahad Al-Maktoum in Gulf Trading)
- Trust structures (Thompson Property Holdings)
- Multiple layers of ownership
- Complexity = Need to verify ultimate beneficial owners

### Why EDD ≠ Rejection

**Critical Learning Point:** The presence of EDD triggers does NOT mean rejection. Instead:

- Escalate case to senior management
- Conduct enhanced verification of wealth/funds
- Document business rationale for structure
- Implement enhanced ongoing monitoring
- **THEN APPROVE** if all enhanced due diligence passes

EDD is about "careful increased scrutiny" not "automatic rejection." Many legitimate, low-risk customers trigger EDD based on wealth level or complexity alone.

## Step 0 Verification with EDD Focus

### Search 1: Adverse Media (Comprehensive International Scope)
**Expected Result:** CLEAR

EDD-level searches go beyond standard:
- Include ICIJ offshore leak databases (Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, Pandora Papers)
- Focus on high-profile international coverage
- Cross-check against regulatory enforcement in multiple jurisdictions
- 10-year time horizon minimum

**Finding:** No adverse coverage, no regulatory issues, no offshore leak matches

### Search 2: Directorships (Complete Mapping)
**Expected Result:** 3 ACTIVE COMPANIES IDENTIFIED & MAPPED

EDD-level directorship checks:
- Map all jurisdictions where customer has operated
- Identify co-shareholders and verify their backgrounds
- Trace beneficial ownership through layers (if present)
- Assess directorship history for patterns

**Finding:** All 3 companies identified, verified, disclosed. Co-shareholder verified (Fahad Al-Maktoum, 15+ year business partner, low risk).

### Search 3: PEP Status (Extended Family Check)
**Expected Result:** NOT PEP (but extended family verified)

EDD-level PEP screening:
- Check immediate family members
- Check extended family for political connections
- Assess business associate PEP risk
- Consider former PEP status (risk persists 12+ months)

**Finding:** Not PEP. Spouse: Not PEP. Cousin (Sir Michael Thompson, QC): Legal profession, not political position. Business partner: No PEP connections.

### Search 4: Professional Background (Detailed Verification)
**Expected Result:** VERIFIED - 25+ YEARS DOCUMENTED

EDD-level background verification:
- Deep dive into business history
- Verify source of initial capital
- Document business growth trajectory
- Cross-verify claims against company accounts and public records

**Finding:** Software business (2000-2019) → Built to £2m+ revenue → Sold for £8.5m → Reinvested in new ventures. Documented through company accounts, acquisition agreements, bank statements.

### Search 5: Sanctions & Crime (Comprehensive)
**Expected Result:** CLEAR

EDD-level sanctions screening:
- Multiple databases beyond standard (OpenSanctions, court records, etc.)
- Check related entities and beneficial owners
- International law enforcement searches
- Financial crime database checks

**Finding:** No matches in any sanctions list. No criminal record. No financial enforcement actions.

## Wealth Source Analysis (EDD Component)

### Why Wealth Source Documentation Matters

For standard LOW-risk customers (Case 1), wealth source documentation is simple:
- "Employed as software engineer, salary £85k" = DONE

For EDD customers, wealth source analysis is extensive:
- How did customer accumulate £18-22 million?
- What documentation supports this narrative?
- Are there any gaps or inconsistencies?
- Is the wealth source legitimate?

### Alexander Thompson's Wealth Source

**Documented Narrative:**

| Period | Event | Amount | Documentation |
|--------|-------|--------|---|
| 2000-2010 | Built Thompson Software Solutions from startup to profitable business | £2m+ annual revenue achieved | Company accounts 2000-2010 |
| 2010 | Acquired by TechGlobal plc | £8.5 million sale price | Acquisition agreement, news articles |
| 2010 | After-tax proceeds reinvested | ~£7 million net | Bank statements showing fund flow |
| 2010-2025 | Thompson Capital investment company | 15 years of business profits | Company accounts 2010-2025 |
| 2015-2025 | Gulf Trading & Logistics | 11 years of dividends and profits | Company accounts, dividend records |
| 2018-2025 | Thompson Property Holdings | Real estate investment program | Property valuations, purchase documents |
| Current | Diversified portfolio | Stocks, bonds, real estate, business equity | Investment statements, property records |

**Documentation Status:** COMPREHENSIVE
- Business sale: DOCUMENTED with acquisition agreement
- Fund flow: DOCUMENTED with bank statements
- Reinvestment: DOCUMENTED with company accounts
- Ongoing income: DOCUMENTED with annual accounts
- Net worth composition: DOCUMENTED with portfolio statements

**Assessment:** WEALTH SOURCE CREDIBLE & WELL-DOCUMENTED

## Risk Assessment & EDD Scoring

### Overall Risk Score: 62/100 (HIGH)

Unlike Case 1 which scored LOW (13/100), this case scores HIGH due to:

| Factor | Case 1 (John Smith) | Case 2 (Alexander Thompson) | Reason |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Geographic | 10 | 45 | UK low-risk vs UAE multi-jurisdictional |
| Customer | 15 | 60 | Employee vs HNWI with complex structure |
| Product | 15 | 50 | Simple account vs large transaction volume |
| Channel | 10 | 30 | Standard vs HNWI applicant |
| **TOTAL** | **13 (LOW)** | **62 (HIGH)** | **Complexity requires high risk rating** |

### Why HIGH Risk Score Does NOT Mean REJECT

The risk score of 62/100 places this case in the HIGH band (61-100). However:

**HIGH Risk ≠ Unacceptable Risk**

HIGH Risk Rating Requires:
- [✓] Escalation for senior review
- [✓] Enhanced documentation
- [✓] Enhanced ongoing monitoring
- [✓] More frequent reviews
- [✓] Formal approval decision

HIGH Risk Rating Does NOT Require:
- Automatic rejection
- Additional source of funds documentation (already provided)
- Proof of legitimacy (already demonstrated)
- Refusal to onboard

**Key Insight:** The risk score is HIGH because the customer is complex and high-volume. But complexity with clean verification + documented wealth source = APPROVABLE WITH CONDITIONS.

## EDD Approval Workflow

### Standard Onboarding (Case 1: John Smith)
```
Application → Step 0 Searches → Risk Assessment (LOW) → Analyst Approval → DONE
```
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Approval:** Analyst self-approval
**Authority:** Level 1

### EDD Onboarding (Case 2: Alexander Thompson)
```
Application → Step 0 Searches → Risk Assessment (HIGH) → Escalation →
Manager Review → MLRO Approval → Enhanced Conditions Set → Onboarding
```
**Time:** 4-6 days
**Approval:** Compliance Manager + MLRO
**Authority:** Level 3-4

### Escalation Rationale

When does a case escalate?
1. **Risk Score HIGH (61-100):** Automatic escalation
2. **Risk Score MEDIUM with RED FLAGS:** Escalation for review
3. **EDD Triggers present:** Automatic escalation
4. **Discrepancies found:** Escalation for investigation
5. **PEP/Sanctions matches:** Immediate escalation

In this case: Risk score 62/100 + HNWI classification = Automatic escalation to Manager/MLRO

### Approval Authority Hierarchy
| Level | Authority | Cases | Decisions |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Analyst | LOW risk only | PROCEED (self-approval) |
| 2 | Senior Analyst | LOW-MEDIUM risk | PROCEED (with recommendation) |
| 3 | Manager | MEDIUM-HIGH risk | PROCEED/CONDITIONAL/REJECT |
| 4 | MLRO | HIGH risk, EDD | FINAL DECISION |

Alexander Thompson case requires **Level 3-4** approval (Manager + MLRO)

## Enhanced Monitoring Conditions

If approved (recommended: YES), the customer would be subject to enhanced monitoring:

### Enhanced Monitoring Parameters

**Transaction Monitoring:**
- Standard: Quarterly review of transaction patterns
- Enhanced: Monthly review (4x more frequent)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Standard: £250,000 per transaction
- Enhanced: £50,000 per transaction (5x lower)

**Review Meetings:**
- Standard: Annual relationship review
- Enhanced: Quarterly enhanced due diligence meetings

**KYC Refresh Frequency:**
- Standard: Annual (every 12 months)
- Enhanced: Semi-annual (every 6 months)

**Risk Reassessment:**
- Standard: Every 24 months
- Enhanced: Every 12 months

**Structure Change Reporting:**
- Standard: Annual declaration
- Enhanced: Immediate notification required

**Company Reporting:**
- Standard: On request
- Enhanced: Annual financial statements required

### Why Enhanced Monitoring?

Enhanced monitoring is not punishment—it's risk management. Higher-risk customers need:
- More frequent oversight
- Lower thresholds for alerts
- More documentation
- More senior analyst attention
- Regular touch-point meetings

This increases compliance team confidence and demonstrates regulatory due diligence.

## Key Learning Points

### 1. Escalation Triggers are Objective
Escalation is triggered by:
- Risk score >60/100
- HNWI status (>£2m typically)
- PEP status
- Discrepancies or red flags
- Complex structures requiring senior review

**This is not subjective.** The system applies consistent criteria.

### 2. Escalation ≠ Rejection
Escalation means:
- "This case needs senior management review"
- NOT "This case should be rejected"

Many legitimate, low-risk customers escalate due to wealth or complexity alone.

### 3. HNWI Cases Are Standard
Onboarding HNWI customers is normal business:
- Enhanced due diligence is mandatory
- Enhanced monitoring is standard
- Approval with conditions is typical
- Most HNWI cases PROCEED (not reject)

### 4. Documentation Defeats Complexity
Even complex international business structures can be approved if:
- [✓] Wealth source is documented
- [✓] Beneficial ownership is clear
- [✓] No adverse findings exist
- [✓] Enhanced monitoring is implemented

Documentation transforms "suspicious complexity" into "understood complexity."

### 5. Senior Oversight is Key
EDD approval requires multiple levels:
- Manager: Business and risk assessment
- MLRO: Money laundering risk determination
- Senior Management: Policy decision

This distributed approval reduces individual risk and ensures oversight.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why isn't this case rejected due to complexity?**
A: Complexity alone doesn't justify rejection. The case is escalated for enhanced review. Clean verification + documented wealth source = APPROVABLE WITH CONDITIONS.

**Q: What if the manager disagrees with the analyst's recommendation to approve?**
A: The manager has authority to reject or request additional documentation. This example shows the analyst pathway, but final decision rests with manager/MLRO.

**Q: How often would this customer be reviewed?**
A: Semi-annually (6 months) while on enhanced monitoring. Frequency may increase or decrease based on transaction patterns and ongoing risk assessment.

**Q: Could this customer move from HIGH to MEDIUM risk?**
A: Yes. If after 12-24 months of clean transaction history and verified ongoing business operations, the risk profile could be reassessed downward.

**Q: What would cause immediate escalation to MLRO?**
A: Suspicious transaction patterns, structure changes, new PEP connection, adverse media, or sanctions match would immediately escalate to MLRO.

## Regulatory References

This example demonstrates:
- **UK MLR 2017** - CDD & EDD requirements for high-risk customers
- **EU AMLD5** - Enhanced due diligence obligations
- **FCA Handbook COND 2.3R** - Customer due diligence requirements
- **FATF Recommendation 1** - Risk-based approach (higher risk = more stringent measures)

---

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates professional, compliant HNWI onboarding. The workflow shows:
- **Identification:** What triggers EDD (HNWI status, complexity)
- **Escalation:** How cases route to senior management
- **Verification:** How complex structures are understood through documentation
- **Decision:** How to approve high-risk cases with enhanced conditions
- **Monitoring:** How ongoing oversight is enhanced for higher-risk customers

Use this example to understand that high-risk ≠ unacceptable. With proper due diligence, enhanced monitoring, and senior oversight, complex HNWI cases can be onboarded safely and compliantly.
