# UK & EU Refresh Requirements

## AMLD5 Compliance Framework

**Why refresh matters:** Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5th Amendment) mandates ongoing due diligence for existing customers to detect material changes in beneficial ownership, risk profile, or compliance status.

## Refresh Intervals by Risk Category

### HIGH RISK Customers
- **Frequency:** Annual refresh (minimum)
- **Triggers:** Any material change, suspicious activity, media alerts
- **Rationale:** Higher exposure to financial crime requires continuous monitoring to detect emerging threats early
- **Enhanced:** Quarterly review for politically exposed persons (PEPs), beneficial owners of shell companies, high-value customers with complex structures
- **Documentation:** Full refresh report with change comparison, escalation to MLRO if material changes detected

### MEDIUM RISK Customers
- **Frequency:** Every 2 years (24-month intervals)
- **Triggers:** Business model changes, geographic expansion, new beneficial owners
- **Rationale:** Moderate risk profile allows extended intervals while maintaining reasonable assurance of ongoing compliance
- **Documentation:** Update customer risk profile, note any new adverse media findings
- **Escalation threshold:** Changes affecting business legitimacy or beneficial ownership structure

### LOW RISK Customers
- **Frequency:** Every 3 years (36-month intervals)
- **Triggers:** Significant business changes, address changes outside documented geography
- **Rationale:** Low-risk customers (EU regulated entities, established businesses, transparent structures) require less frequent verification
- **Documentation:** Confirm no material changes, update next refresh date

## Material Change Indicators (AMLD5)

**Beneficial Ownership Changes:**
- New or departed beneficial owner with 25%+ stake
- Change in ultimate beneficial owner
- Nominee or trust structure changes

**Business Structure Changes:**
- Corporate restructuring, mergers, acquisitions
- Change from private to public company or vice versa
- Business pivots to high-risk sectors (crypto, gambling, trade finance)

**Regulatory Changes:**
- Customer becomes regulated entity (triggers reassessment)
- Loss of regulatory status or license
- New regulatory warnings or restrictions

**Risk Profile Changes:**
- Adverse media: sanctions designation, regulatory enforcement, criminal conviction
- Geographic expansion to high-risk jurisdictions
- New high-risk business lines (weapons, financial services, real estate)

## Documentation Requirements

**Refresh Report must contain:**
- Date of refresh and rationale (time-based, risk-based, event-based)
- Summary of 5 independent searches conducted
- Comparison to original onboarding findings
- New findings documented with sources
- Risk re-assessment with justification
- Escalation decision and routing (if material changes)
- HITL checkpoint: Manager review and approval
- Next refresh date scheduled

**Retention:** Minimum 6 years from last customer activity

## Audit Trail
