## ESCALATION BRIEF

**TO:** Compliance Manager & MLRO
**FROM:** KYC Analyst [Analyst ID]
**DATE:** 11 February 2026
**PRIORITY:** HIGH
**CASE:** KYC-20260211-ONB-ROBERTS-001

**SUBJECT:** ESCALATION - Material Misrepresentation in KYC Application

**Background:**
Michael Roberts applied for personal business account on 06/02/2026. Initial assessment appeared straightforward (LOW-MEDIUM risk consultant). However, Step 0 verification revealed material discrepancies between declared information and verified facts.

**The Issue:**
Customer declared: "No company directorships, independent consultant"
Verification revealed: 3 active company directorships with £8.7m annual revenue

**Material Discrepancies:**
1. Roberts Capital Holdings Ltd - 100% shareholder, Managing Director (£2.8m revenue)
2. Roberts Property Development Ltd - 80% shareholder, Director (£4.1m revenue)
3. British Financial Services Group Ltd - 60% shareholder, Director (£1.8m revenue)

**Assessment:**
This is not a minor omission or administrative error. Customer:
- Claimed to be "independent consultant"
- Held three substantial directorships
- Had significant undisclosed business interests
- Provided materially false information

**Questions for Senior Management:**
1. Why did customer omit three significant directorships?
2. Was this deliberate concealment or inadvertent omission?
3. What is the business relationship between the 3 companies?
4. Why was wealth source understated?
5. Are there other undisclosed interests?

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Request written explanation from customer for material omissions
2. Require revised application with complete disclosure
3. Obtain company accounts for all 3 entities
4. Reassess risk profile based on complete information
5. Determine if relationship should proceed

**Recommendation:**
DO NOT PROCEED without resolution of material misrepresentation. Require customer explanation and revised application with full disclosure before decision can be made.
