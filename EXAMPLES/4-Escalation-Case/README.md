# Case 4: Escalation-Case
## Material Misrepresentation Leading to Escalation

**Case ID:** KYC-20260211-ONB-ROBERTS-001
**Customer:** Michael Roberts (Anonymized)
**Scenario:** Applicant omits material business interests; escalates due to integrity concern
**Risk Level:** ESCALATED (Compliance Risk)
**Decision:** ESCALATED TO MANAGER/MLRO - MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION

---

## What This Example Demonstrates

This example shows **what happens when Step 0 verification reveals material discrepancies** between what applicant declared and what verification confirms. Unlike the first three cases (which passed Step 0 verification), this case demonstrates when and why escalation is triggered by integrity concerns rather than risk profile.

### Key Characteristics
- Applicant claims "no directorships, independent consultant"
- Step 0 directorship search reveals 3 active companies
- Material discrepancy between claims and facts
- Undisclosed significant wealth source
- Possible deliberate concealment
- Regulatory red flag

### Learning Objectives
Students should understand:
1. How Step 0 searches catch undisclosed information
2. When material discrepancies trigger escalation
3. What constitutes "material misrepresentation"
4. How to escalate integrity concerns to management
5. Why completeness of KYC information matters
6. Decision-making when facts don't match claims

## Material Misrepresentation Defined

### What is Material Misrepresentation?

**Material** = Important to the KYC decision
**Misrepresentation** = False or misleading statement, or omission of important facts

### Examples in This Case

**Example 1: Undisclosed Directorships**
- Customer declared: "No directorships"
- Verified fact: 3 active directorships
- Assessment: MATERIAL (directorships are fundamental KYC information)

**Example 2: Understated Business Interests**
- Customer declared: "Just consulting fees"
- Verified fact: £8.7m annual business revenue from 3 operating companies
- Assessment: MATERIAL (source of wealth is critical KYC element)

**Example 3: Income Understated**
- Customer declared: "Independent consulting income"
- Verified fact: Substantial business profits from operating companies
- Assessment: MATERIAL (income source affects risk assessment)

### Why This Matters

If customer omits material facts in application:
- KYC assessment is based on incomplete information
- Risk rating might be wrong
- Relationship purpose might be misunderstood
- Firm cannot make informed compliance decision
- Regulatory requirement: Firms must KNOW their customers

## Detection Through Step 0 Verification

### How This Was Discovered

The critical search was **Search 2: Directorships**

**Trigger:** Customer declared "No directorships"
**Verification:** Companies House officer search showed 3 active directorships
**Result:** DISCREPANCY DETECTED

### Why This Search is Critical

Search 2 (Directorships) is specifically designed to catch hidden business interests:

> "Search 2: Directorships - Use Companies House officer search or equivalent registry. Identify ALL company directorships (disclosed and undisclosed). **CRITICAL: This catches hidden business interests**"

In this case, it worked exactly as designed—it caught 3 undisclosed companies.

### The Pattern

**Application Says:** "No companies"
**Companies House Shows:** 3 companies
**Analyst Conclusion:** Customer failed to disclose material facts

---

## Escalation Decision

### When Does Material Misrepresentation Trigger Escalation?

**Escalation Triggers:**
1. Undisclosed directorships = ESCALATE
2. Hidden business interests = ESCALATE
3. Understated wealth source = ESCALATE
4. Discrepancies between claims and verified facts = ESCALATE
5. Potential deliberate concealment = ESCALATE

This case triggers ALL FIVE escalation criteria.

### Who Decides: Analyst vs Manager?

**Analyst Can Approve:**
- LOW risk cases (all verifications clear)
- MEDIUM risk cases with some complexity (clear ownership, transparent structure)

**Manager/MLRO Must Approve:**
- HIGH risk cases
- Cases with material discrepancies
- Cases with integrity concerns
- Cases with undisclosed information

**This Case:** Material misrepresentation = Escalate to Manager/MLRO

### Escalation Path

```
Application Received
    ↓
Step 0 Verification Initiated
    ↓
Search 2 (Directorships): 3 COMPANIES FOUND (not declared)
    ↓
DISCREPANCY DETECTED
    ↓
Material Misrepresentation Identified
    ↓
ESCALATE TO MANAGER/MLRO
    ↓
Pending: Manager/MLRO Decision
```

## What Happens Next (Pending Manager Decision)

### Option 1: Request Explanation
Manager contacts customer:
- "Your application stated no directorships, but Companies House shows 3 active companies. Please explain."
- Request written explanation
- Determine if deliberate or inadvertent

### Option 2: Request Revised Application
Manager requires:
- New application with complete disclosure
- All directorships listed
- All shareholdings disclosed
- Complete wealth source information

### Option 3: Request Additional Documentation
Obtain:
- Company accounts for all 3 entities
- Proof of income sources
- Explanation of business relationships
- Verification of co-directors/shareholders

### Option 4: Risk Reassessment
Once complete information received:
- Reassess risk profile based on actual business structure
- Determine if legitimate business reason for omission
- Verify co-directors' backgrounds
- Re-evaluate relationship risk

### Option 5: Possible Rejection
If customer cannot explain omissions or refuses to provide information:
- **Recommendation:** REJECT relationship
- **Reason:** Integrity concerns, incomplete KYC, regulatory risk
- **Alternative:** Could consider SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) if pattern suggests AML concern

## Key Learning Points

### 1. Step 0 Verification Catches Undisclosed Information

The five-step verification process is specifically designed to catch discrepancies like this:
- Search 1 (Adverse Media): Catches public controversies
- **Search 2 (Directorships): Catches undisclosed companies** ← THIS WAS THE KEY
- Search 3 (PEP): Catches political connections
- Search 4 (Background): Catches employment discrepancies
- Search 5 (Sanctions): Catches criminal/financial crime

In this case, Search 2 functioned exactly as intended—it found the hidden directorships.

### 2. Material Discrepancies Require Escalation

If declared information contradicts verified information, the case MUST escalate. Examples:
- "I have no directorships" but Companies House shows 3
- "I'm not PEP" but PEP database shows political position
- "No adverse media" but found regulatory violations
- "No criminal record" but found convictions

Any of these = ESCALATE.

### 3. Integrity Matters More Than Risk Score

A high-risk customer can be approved if fully transparent and verified.
A low-risk customer can be rejected if dishonest about material facts.

In this case:
- Risk score might be moderate (£8.7m business = higher volume)
- But integrity concern overrides risk assessment
- Material misrepresentation = Regulatory red flag
- Must escalate regardless of risk score

### 4. Omission = Misrepresentation

Not stating information is as bad as stating false information:
- Saying "no directorships" when you have 3 = MISREPRESENTATION
- Failing to mention 3 directorships = OMISSION (also misrepresentation)
- Either way = Material misrepresentation

### 5. Manager/MLRO Role

Managers/MLROs handle cases where:
- Analyst approval is insufficient
- Material issues require senior judgment
- Integrity concerns need investigation
- Relationship rejection is being considered
- Complex decisions need senior authority

This case exemplifies why manager oversight exists—to catch and investigate integrity issues.

## Regulatory Implications

### Why This Matters to Regulators

Regulators (FCA, Treasury) care about:
1. **Did firm know its customer?** (KYC requirement)
2. **Did firm obtain complete information?** (CDD requirement)
3. **Did firm discover discrepancies?** (Controls testing)
4. **Did firm escalate material issues?** (Risk management)

This case tests all four:
1. Firm's KYC was incomplete (customer omitted material facts)
2. Firm's CDD would have failed (incomplete information)
3. Firm's Step 0 control worked (discrepancy detected)
4. Firm escalated appropriately (issue routed to manager)

**Regulatory Assessment:** GOOD outcome (control detected issue and escalated). BAD outcome if firm had proceeded without investigating.

## Common Questions

**Q: Is this customer definitely a fraud risk?**
A: Not necessarily. Could be innocent omission (forgot to mention them). Could be deliberate concealment (integrity concern). Manager's job is to investigate and determine which. Either way, cannot proceed without explanation.

**Q: What if customer provides innocent explanation?**
A: Then restart KYC with complete information. Re-score risk based on actual business structure. Make approval decision based on complete facts.

**Q: What if customer refuses to explain?**
A: Then recommend rejection. Customer's refusal to cooperate with KYC requirements is itself a red flag.

**Q: Could this be a SAR?**
A: Possibly. If evidence suggests deliberate AML/CFT evasion (hiding wealth source, complex structures, trying to avoid scrutiny), could warrant Suspicious Activity Report to NCA.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates a fundamental KYC principle: **Complete information is required to make compliant onboarding decisions.** When Step 0 verification reveals material discrepancies, the case must be escalated to senior management for investigation and decision. The quality of KYC controls is measured by how well they catch and flag exactly these types of issues.
